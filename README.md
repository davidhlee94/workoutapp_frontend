## ⭐ Getting Started ⭐
Welcome to Gainzville, the simple workout planning platform. At Gainzville, our mission is to help users maximize their time at the gym and achieve their fitness goals with ease. We aim to eliminate the frustration of wondering what exercises to do and instead, give users the tools to plan and execute effective workouts beforehand. With our platform, users can spend less time thinking about their workout and more time actually doing it, making the most of their time and effort.<br>

Upon entering the home page, users can access our Muscle Info page and learn about different muscle groups and exercises. To get the most out of our platform, we encourage you to create an account. With an account, you can start planning your workouts and adding exercises to them. Our goal is to make your workout planning process easy and accessible, so you can focus on reaching your fitness objectives.

## 🤔 Why a workout tracker? 🤔
Gainzville was born from the frustration of searching for a simple and affordable workout planning solution. After trying multiple apps that either lacked a user-friendly interface or costed money, I decided to create a platform that would meet the needs of fitness enthusiasts like myself. With Gainzville, users no longer have to struggle with complicated interfaces and hidden costs. Gainzville's platform is designed to be easy to use and accessible to everyone, so users can spend more time reaching their fitness goals.<br><br>

When building this project, I was able to: <br>

✅ Create a Workout App that allows users to create workout plans and add exercises to them<br>
✅ Allow users to view major muscle groups and see the best workouts for those groups<br>
✅ Sharpen my understanding of JWT Authentication<br><br>

## ⏭️ Whats next? ⏭️
Here are a few stretch goals I look to accomplish in the future:<br>

📄 An even simpler UI<br>
📄 Ability to update current exercise weight<br>
📄 Sorting feature
