    "description": "The abdominal muscles, commonly referred to as the abs, are a group of muscles located in the front of the torso that play a key role in supporting the spine and assisting with movements such as bending and twisting. The most well-known abdominal muscle is the rectus abdominis, which creates the 'six-pack' appearance when developed. To exercise the abs, a variety of exercises can be performed such as crunches, sit-ups, planks, Russian twists, and bicycle crunches. These exercises can be done with or without equipment and can be incorporated into a full-body workout routine or done as a separate ab workout. It's important to remember to engage the core and maintain proper form to avoid injury and effectively target the abs."
